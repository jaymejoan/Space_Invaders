# Space_Invaders
For my CGRA151 (computer graphics) course, I chose to recreate the classic game Space Invaders. 

I wrote all of the code from scratch and ran it on Processing. Received A+ for this projectðŸ˜Ž

**Why Space Invaders?**

It's awesome. 

As a kid, I had a family friend who had the actual space invaders table. I'd spent hours playing and I always thought it'd be such an awesome game to code (it was definitely fun to test!).
